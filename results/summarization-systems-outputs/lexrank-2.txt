italy and germany will lose a significantly smaller number of points -lrb- 11.571 and 15.666 respectively -rrb- meaning that by the beginning of next season , england will have slumped to third , and be in danger of falling further . <s> with juventus in pole position to reach the semi-finals of the champions league , napoli all but into the last four of the europa league , and fiorentina in with a chance of joining them , italy are likely to out-score england by at least four points this season , and that margin would grow if all three italian clubs reach the final of their respective competitions .

ozil is just that . <s> at the start of the season , i picked out bafetimbi gomis as one to watch .
kolo toure and mamadou sakho are both solid enough but they are nervous in possession and they will miss the experience and physicality of skrtel . <s> ramsey can grab a goal , and liverpool will have to watch his runs into the box , but henderson will press hard and make sure ramsey and the likes of mesut ozil and santi cazorla have no room to breathe .

there will be a white-hot atmosphere at white hart lane on saturday afternoon when aston villa come to town but tim sherwood has got to keep his emotions in check . <s> he did a good job at tottenham -- he 's never afraid to talk about having the best premier league win percentage of any spurs boss -- but was still not trusted with the job long-term .
what has been surprising is the way they have come on this season . <s> it helps that all three have had a taste of playing at full back .
mccoy said he had initially thought he could go quietly on his final day at sandown but his agent dave roberts helped him come to the decision of making the announcement early and giving racing fans a chance to say their farewells . <s> ` when i decided to retire i always thought i 'd go to sandown on the last day and say ` thanks very much ' but having spoken to dave , he said i was very privileged to be champion jockey for the 20th time and we kind of felt , for my own piece of mind , to do it like we did would help me come to terms with actually retiring , ' he said .
it was like that when the rest of the jockeys who have trailed in his wake for so long formed an honour guard as he walked into the parade ring to be presented with the champion jockey trophy for the 20th consecutive time , by ian wright , one of mccoy 's arsenal heroes . <s> it is hard to call an end to a career like that -- and in the 11 weeks since he announced this would be his last season , he has never tried to disguise the pain .
