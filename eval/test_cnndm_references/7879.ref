jeff and joey stallings took a ` bad batch ' of spice in mississippi hometown .
hospitalized after suffering from hallucinations , sweats and violent shaking .
photos show the brothers in medically-induced comas in mccomb hospital .
fortunately , siblings rallied against the drug 's effects and are now at home .
but jeff has ` permanent kidney damage ' and both are still addicted to drug .
now , their mom , karen , has begged others not to take synthetic marijuana .
because chemicals in spice vary , users do not know what they 're smoking .
