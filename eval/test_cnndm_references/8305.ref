despite the charges , the judge told the millionaire retiree that he is allowed to take a previously planned vacation to the bahamas .
bates has said he mistakenly pulled out his gun instead of his taser when he shot eric harris , who was fleeing from a sting operation on april 2 .
on tuesday , harris ' family said that while they continue to mourn the loss of their loved one , bates will be enjoying his ` wealth and privilege ' abroad .
