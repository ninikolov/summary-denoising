emma dickson was taking the contraceptive pill and then was taken to hospital after suffering with sharp pains last november .
doctors said she had developed blood clots , which can be caused by synthetic hormones in the pill , and clots had moved up to her lungs .
clots , or pulmonary embolisms , were wedged in mrs dickson 's lungs and caused pleural effusion - where fluid starts to build up around the lungs .
fluid caused her left lung to collapse and she thought she would die .
