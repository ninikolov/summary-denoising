peter moskos : reserve cop , 73 , meant to use a taser on a man , but shot him dead instead . why was a volunteer cop witha gun in a violent crimes unit ?
he says the man may have bought his way in with donations to police . cops are , and should be , wary of those a little too eager to be police .
moskos : right approach is unarmed auxiliary cops , like in nyc , volunteering as a way to connect public to police .
