khloe kardashian posted a photo to instagram during monday night 's riots that said : ` pray for baltimore '
despite getting over 400,000 likes , the post drew criticism that she was insincere and unable to relate to the issues due to her privileged background .
other critics felt she should focus her prayers elsewhere , such as the victims of the nepal earthquake .
just 30 minutes later she tweeted that she was : ` damned if i do . damned if i do n't ' , and asked : ` now it 's wrong to pray ? '
the instagram post has since been deleted .
protests about the unexplained death of freddie gray have now spread to six american cities .
