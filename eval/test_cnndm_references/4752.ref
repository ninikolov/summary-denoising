chris ramsey , the only black manager in the premier league , is a classic example .
ramsey is a fine coach who has been overlooked for countless jobs .
he took the qpr position after harry redknapp saw the writing on the wall and got out .
ramsey was asked to board the sinking ship and , guess what , it has not been an easy job to refloat it .
