sunderland manager dick advocaat insists he is not underestimating the significance of sunday 's game against local rivals newcastle .
while in charge of rangers in 1998 , advocaat made the mistake of playing down the old firm game against celtic and lost 5-1 .
the dutchman does not want a repeat of that embarrassment .
he is considering starting winger adam johnson for the game , for the first time for his arrest on suspicion of sexual activity with a 15-year-old girl .
