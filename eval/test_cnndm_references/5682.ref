anthony stokes died on tuesday after he crashed a stolen car into a pole while fleeing from the scene of an attempted burglary in roswell , georgia .
he had fired at an elderly woman after breaking into her home .
less than two years ago , he was given a life-saving heart transplant .
he was initially denied the surgery because doctors said he had previously failed to take medication so would be ` non-compliant ' with the treatment .
but they changed their minds following pressure from civil rights groups and the boy 's family , who said he had been stereotyped as a troubled teen .
after the transplant , he said he was grateful for a second chance at life .
