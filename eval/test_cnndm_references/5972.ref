the company says it expects the new ` artisan grilled chicken ' to be in its more than 14,300 u.s. stores by the end of next week .
it says the biggest change is the removal of sodium phosphates , which it said was used to keep the chicken moist , in favor of vegetable starch .
the new recipe also does not use maltodextrin , which mcdonald 's said is generally used as a sugar to increase browning or as a carrier for seasoning .
