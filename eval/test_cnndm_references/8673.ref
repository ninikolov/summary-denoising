kefalonia is stunning and does n't play the captain corelli 's mandolin card .
island has n't been tainted by the crowds its greek counterparts get .
it 's a quarter of the size of spain 's majorca but with a 20th of the tourists .
the one must-do outing in kefalonia is to fiskardo , a lovely harbour .
