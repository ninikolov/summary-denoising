massey shaw was requisitioned from the london fire brigade and helped rescue 600 troops from dunkirk in 1940 .
the vessel went on to save st paul 's cathedral during the blitz before being commissioned in 1971 .
but the fire boat has been renovated and restored to its former glory by a group of volunteers thanks to lottery grant .
they are now seeking another # 10,000 so they can transport the massey shaw back to dunkirk 70 years later .
