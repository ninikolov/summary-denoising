this residence was once just a garage for a much bigger mansion called homeden .
when homeden was being converted into flats the owners of the garage bought some of the original features .
the blackwood and copperlight archway was taken and tastefully adapted to suit the light-filled property .
the stylish 740 square-metre , four bedroom , converted residence will go to auction on 16 may .
