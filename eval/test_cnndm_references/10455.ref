willa junior took a nap in the cargo hold of a plane at seattle-tacoma airport on april 13 , and woke up after the flight to los angeles took off .
the baggage handler , who appears to be in his 20s according to facebook , tried calling his company and 911 but his phone eventually failed .
he says he was afraid he might die , so he texted his mother a message , telling her ' i love you '
in a last ditch effort , junior started banging on the ceiling of the cargo hold and his yells were so loud that passengers and crew heard .
the flight was turned around after just 14 minutes in the air and returned to seattle where junior was rescued .
junior is still employed at his company , but is no longer allowed to work on alaska airlines flights - one the largest airlines that fly out of seattle .
