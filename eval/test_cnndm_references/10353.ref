the alarm system at the former president 's houston property failed around september 2013 but was not replaced until december 2014 .
it came after an agent recommended in 2010 that the 20-year system be replaced but the request was denied .
the details emerged in a report by the department of homeland security office of inspector general released on thursday .
the report recommended that the agency reviews all security equipment .
