a los angeles judge ruled this week that v. stiviano must return $ 2.6 million in gifts she was given by former clippers owner donald sterling .
shelly sterling said on wednesday that she feels vindicated by the win and will be giving the money to charity .
she said that she and sterling never split and , even though she drew up divorce papers last year , she never filed them .
the ruling came a year after the nba banned sterling for life over a recording of him telling stiviano not to associate with black people .
