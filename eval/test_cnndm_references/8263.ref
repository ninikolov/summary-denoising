tulsa county sheriff 's office reserve deputy robert bates faces a charge of second-degree manslaughter for the april 2 shooting of eric harris .
in an interview on the today show on friday , he described his shock and remorse at the shooting and how he never intended to kill anyone .
he demonstrated that he kept his taser near his chest and his gun on his right side - but insisted the mix-up could have happened to anyone .
bates said he had completed all proper training and was not allowed to ` play cop ' just because he had donated equipment to the sheriff 's office .
