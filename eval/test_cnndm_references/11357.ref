the crumbling st ivan rilski church is the only remaining evidence of the community of zapalnya , bulgaria .
named after the patron saint of bulgaria , the stone structure cuts a ghostly figure in the zhrebchevo reservoir .
the settlement and two other villages were wiped out when the land was submerged in 1965 .
