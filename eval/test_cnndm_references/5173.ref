grand prairie , texas officials say rick yoes , 57 , has refused to respond to two decades worth of code violations for unruly lawn .
when he received notice that he owed $ 1,700 and that there was a warrant out of his arrest , yoes reported to jail instead of paying the fine .
he spent two nights in jail before a friend paid the fine and secured his release .
officials for the city say they would never arrest someone for not mowing their lawn and that yoes had plenty of opportunities to work with them .
