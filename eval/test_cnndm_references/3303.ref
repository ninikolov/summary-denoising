josh meekings was given a retrospective one-match ban for a handball .
the incident was n't punished in inverness 's scottish cup win over celtic .
the ban , which is being appealed , would rule meekings out of the cup final .
celtic wrote to the sfa asking why why no penalty or red card followed .
jim boyce said he was speaking in a personal capacity , not for fifa .
