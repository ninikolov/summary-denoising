andrea catherwood stayed at the modern masterpiece hotel arts .
dined in the hotel 's two michelin-starred flagship restaurant , enoteca .
drank miraval ros√© from brad pitt and angelina jolie 's estate in provence .
of all the stunning buildings , the one i 'm drawn to is gaudi 's casa batllo .
a great city to get lost in with some of the best sights not in tourist guides .
