clorox has apologized for a social media misstep .
the company sparked outrage by tweeting ` where 's the bleach ' in reference to last week 's introduction of new 'em oji ' cartoons for iphones .
those cartoons included faces of people with black and brown skin .
the company says it was attempting a humorous reference to other emojis for objects like toilets and bathtubs that people use bleach to clean .
its post hit a nerve when news reports and online discussions were focusing on the new collection of racially diverse faces .
