brian klawiter posted a message on his company 's facebook page announcing that openly gay people are not welcome at his business .
he claims the decision is based on his religious views and michigan does n't currently have laws in place preventing such discrimination .
critics have accused him of trying to cash in on the anti-gay backlash which netted an indiana pizzeria over $ 840,000 earlier this month .
klawiter claims he does n't need the money and has a successful business but at least one manfacturer has asked him to remove its logo from his site .
