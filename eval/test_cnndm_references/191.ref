mark o'mara : video captured michael slager shooting walter scott ; if cop had been wearing a body camera , he probably would n't have fired .
o'mara says such cameras are expensive , but cheaper than wrongful death payouts -- and the cost of a human life .
the underlying problem is racial bias in policing ; until that 's solved , body cameras are a good interim solution .
