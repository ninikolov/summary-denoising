geoff johnson and jennifer mcshea both grew up with a mother who compulsively hoarded things .
refrigerator did n't work , trash piled up , but nothing was fixed . it left them with deep-rooted feelings of shame .
two decades after they left , their mother died and the house was passed to them .
they have revisited and created a photo series , superimposing their children onto photos of the house to show the uneasy sight of youngsters growing up in that environment .
