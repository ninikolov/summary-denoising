caretakers of lincoln 's tomb are on the defensive over an unflattering magazine critique and looming budget cuts .
the site was pilloried in this month 's issue of national geographic magazine as having ` all the historical character of an office lobby '
gov. bruce rauner has proposed eliminating the state historic preservation agency , which manages the tomb .
rauner would roll the agency into another department .
lincoln 's tomb was designed by vermont sculptor larkin mead , who won a national contest .
it was dedicated by president ulysses s. grant in 1874 .
the tomb was reconstructed in both 1899 and 1930 .
