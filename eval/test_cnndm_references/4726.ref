boeing 747 can normally hold up to 600 people but this model was customised for a single ultra-wealthy tycoon .
digital images show how the interior is as luxurious as an expensive hotel room despite space constraints .
the jumbo jet contains a master bedroom , ` aeroloft ' with added sleeping space , and a large dining room .
it is also kitted out for business with a conference room and office so the owner is never out of touch with work .
