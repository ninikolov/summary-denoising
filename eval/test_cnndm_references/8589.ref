wildlife photographer einar gudmann caught the violent encounter on camera while he was camping in iceland .
after emerging into bitter sub-zero temperatures from his tent he spotted a female and male fox copulating .
but the pair were n't alone - a third arctic fox lurked nearby and wasted no time in battling his rival for the female .
the losing fox was seen by the photographer limping off up a snowy hill and was n't expected to last the night .
