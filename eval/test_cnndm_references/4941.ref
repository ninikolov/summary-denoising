geraldine alcorn , 29 , of pittsburgh waived a preliminary hearing on a felony charge that she interfered with the parental custody of her 11-year-old student .
in exchange for the waiver prosecutors dropped two misdemeanors alcorn faced : luring a child into a vehicle and corruption of minors .
police believe her interest in the child was not sexual , but it was obsessive and she allegedly told the girl she wanted to run away with her .
the girl 's mother , a single parent , complained to school officials after finding out alcorn had visited the girl at their home while the mother was working .
