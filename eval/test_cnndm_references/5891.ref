group of vicars say coe schools should stop selecting pupils on faith .
many christian schools give priority to those who regularly attend church .
but vicars argue the system is open to abuse and oversubscribed schools may reject non-churchgoing families even though they may live nearby .
clergymen said affluent parents were more likely to cheat the system by going to church just to get their children into a high-performing coe school .
