a dozen native american extras and the cultural adviser walked off the set of adam sandler 's new movie on wednesday .
the film , the ridiculous 6 , is a spoof of the magnificent seven that is being made for netflix .
one extra who walked off claims that the production crew and director ignored their complaints about offensive jokes .
this included inaccurate costumes and referring to one woman as ` beaver 's breath '
the film also stars nick nolte , steve buscemi , blake shelton and taylor lautner , who has previously said he has distant native american ancestry .
netflix said in a statement ; ` it is a broad satire of western movies and the stereotypes they popularized , featuring a diverse cast that is not only part of - but in on - the joke '
