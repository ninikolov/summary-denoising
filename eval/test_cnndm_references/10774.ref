an indiana public school performance of american pie ended in tragedy wednesday when a riser buckled just as dozens danced on-stage .
more than a dozen people were injured at the westfield high performance and one student was taken to a hospital in critical condition .
students said there had been no issues when they previously practiced the song on the stage with the same number of people .
