hannah and alex needed a place to live after they moved back to new zealand from the uk in 2009 .
so , they purchased a 1986 hino flatbed truck and started building a home on the back of it over the course of about a year and a half .
they then purchased a secluded piece of property and drove their nearly self-sufficient $ 25,000 home there .
