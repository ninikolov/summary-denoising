army major john jackson and his wife carolyn are facing 15 counts of child abuse .
the couple 's first trial ended in a mistrial last november when a prosecutor accidentally mentioned the death of one of their son 's .
that detail was barred from the trial since the couple had not been officially charged in the boy 's death .
on monday , the jacksons appeared in new jersey federal court for their second trial .
prosecutors said the couple starved their three foster children and beat them so several that they had broken bones all over their bodies .
the couple 's defense attorneys claim that they may have been ` crappy parents ' but are not criminals .
