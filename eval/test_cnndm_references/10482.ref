adrian langlais died on march 19 , the day after his second birthday , from head injuries allegedly caused by his mother 's boyfriend christian tyrrell .
the toddler 's adoptive grandparents say they started noticing bruises on the boy in november , when mother jessica langlais started dating tyrrell .
they say jessica ignored their warnings , and that child protective services cleared tyrrell of any wrong doing a month before adrian 's death .
tyrrell was arrested wednesday on capital murder charges and is being held on $ 1million bond .
