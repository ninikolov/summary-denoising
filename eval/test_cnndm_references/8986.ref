twin 18-month-old boys were pulled from a yuma , arizona canal on friday .
authorities still have not explained what led the boys to be swept away in the canal , but they do n't suspect foul play .
over the weekend , a go fund me page was set up to cover their memorial and medical costs .
the campaign page identified the boys as eli and silas keslar , sons of mark and alexis keslar .
