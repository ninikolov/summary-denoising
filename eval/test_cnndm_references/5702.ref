anthony corrales claims he was driving with his wife and daughter last june near a casino in new york city when a car cut in front of him .
corrales claims he got out to write down the car 's license plate number , and was then mowed down and driven for several blocks on the hood .
the driver of that car , robert muller , was let off by police while corrales was charged with harassment and breaking the windshield .
muller claimed it was corrales who jumped on the hood of his car after telling him ; ` get out of the car tough guy '
video footage from the casino shows corrales on the car hood while muller drives with his wife and daughter in the car .
` instead of deterring mr. muller from future dangerous acts of road rage , the police ensured that he can continue to use his car as a weapon with impunity , ' said corrales ' lawyer leo glickman .
