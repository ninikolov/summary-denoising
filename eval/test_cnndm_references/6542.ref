arnold breitenbach of st. george , utah , wanted to get ` cib-69 ' put on a license plate .
that would have commemorated both breitenbach getting the purple heart in 1969 and his combat infantryman 's badge .
the utah dmv denied his request , citing state regulations prohibiting the use of the number 69 because of its sexual connotations .
