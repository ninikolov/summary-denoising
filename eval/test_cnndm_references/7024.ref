chelsea clinton is opening up about motherhood , life in the public eye and why the united states needs a female president in a new interview with elle .
clinton says that though the us is the ` land of equal opportunity , ' that is not true about gender , and a female president would change that .
this just two days before her mother hillary is expected to announce her presidential campaign .
` it is challenging to me that women comprising 20 percent of congress is treated as a real success . since when did 20 percent become the definition of equality ? ' says clinton .
clinton , who is described in the magazine as ` innately regal , also appears in a fashion spread in which she looks almost unrecognizable .
