joe root has been terrific to bounce back from a difficult time in australia .
root 's 182 * in the first innings in grenada showed he is a steely competitor .
he looks a natural no 3 , but england should n't move him from current spot .
the captaincy always wears players down , and it is n't his time yet .
ben stokes is right to be passionate , but needs to keep his cool as well .
