thousands of the jellyfish-like creatures , known as velella velella , are covering beaches across oregon , california and washington .
the creatures have small sails on their bodies , which means they are easily blown towards the shore during strong winds this time of year .
they are not harmful to humans but will begin to smell as they rot .
