kenneth stancil made his first appearance in a north carolina court on thursday after he was transferred from a florida jail .
in an expletive-filled rant , he told the judge he knew he was going to get life in prison but shot dead his boss for wanting to molest his brother .
his victim , ron lane , and brother had never met and there were no complaints against lane when he was shot dead on monday .
stancil has admitted that he partly shot lane - who had been his work supervisor before he was fired last month - for being gay .
