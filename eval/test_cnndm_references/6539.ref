the woolworths ` fresh in our memories ' campaign launched last week .
it invited customers to upload images to remember australian soldiers .
the supermarket then added a woolworths logo and slogan to the image .
customers took to social media to mock the campaign and express their anger with what they saw as a marketing ploy by the company .
the soldier whose image was used to plug the campaign is unidentified .
all that is know about the young man is that his photo was taken sometime between 1915 and 1918 before the he embarked from australia for service .
