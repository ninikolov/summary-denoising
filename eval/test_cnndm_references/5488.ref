naked art fans attended an hour-long nude tour at the national gallery of australia in canberra on wednesday night .
the tour took place outside regular exhibition hours , as it is illegal to be naked in public .
fans viewed the exhibition , ` james turrell : a retrospective ' led by experienced nude tour guide stuart ringholt .
` everyone 's all in it together , so it 's not weird or anything , ' said one man .
the 70-year-old artist has put on a nude exhibition before in japan , and was keen to replicate the experience for his body of work in australia .
