researchers at the lawrence berkeley national laboratory used real skin samples to study microscopic changes that resist tears when pulled apart .
they found collagen fibres in dermis change structure when under strain .
the fibres go from being a disorganised tangle to straighten and stretch .
scientists hope their findings can help develop new tear-resistant materials .
