hattie gladwell , 19 , blogs about her experience of living with an ostomy bag after undergoing emergency surgery for ulcerative colitis .
she is calling for a new anti-smoking advert to be banned because it warns that they might get colon cancer and be forced to use a bag like her .
' i am utterly disgusted that they feel they can advertise a quit smoking campaign with something that has saved so many lives ' she wrote .
she complains that the ad suggests people who use bags have brought the condition on themselves .
