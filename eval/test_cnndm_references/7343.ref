glen walford , 75 , grew up in her parents ' house in stourport-upon-severn .
the theatre director 's mother mary was forced to move into care in 2006 .
worcestershire county council tried to sell the house to pay for her care .
but miss walford fought them , claiming the property was hers to retire to .
high court sided with the walford family who were allowed to keep house .
but its decision was overturned in the court of appeal earlier this year .
now the council will decide whether or not to put the house on the market .
