john helinski , 62 , slept in a cardboard box in tampa bay for three years .
he applied for homeless housing , but struggled as he had no identification .
it had all been stolen years earlier - virtually forcing him onto the streets .
a case worker and a cop looked into his past and uncovered his records .
helsinki then went into a tampa bank and discovered a lost account .
enough money and social security was in there for him to buy a house .
