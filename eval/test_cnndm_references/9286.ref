budi was introduced to jemmi less than a month ago and now the two apes appear to be inseparable .
indeed , video from the international animal rescue 's orangutan center in indonesia , shows the duo throwing adoring glances at each other .
budi was dying from malnutrition and too weak to move when he was discovered in borneo , indonesia , last december .
meanwhile , eight-month-old jemmi was orphaned when her mother was killed and then illegally sold as a pet .
