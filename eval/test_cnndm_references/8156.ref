emergency services were called to the kosciuszko bridge at about 11.50 am monday , where a woman had climbed over the bridge 's railing and was standing on a section of metal piping .
officers tried to calm her down as nypd patrol boats cruised under the bridge on newtown creek , which connects greenpoint in brooklyn and maspeth in queens .
a witness said the woman was a 44-year-old polish mother-of-one who was going through a tough divorce .
she agreed to be rescued after police talked to her about her daughter and was taken to elmhurst hospital .
