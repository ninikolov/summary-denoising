brandon afoa , 33 , of puyallup was operating a tug to push back aircraft at seattle-tacoma international airport when the brakes and steering failed , causing him to crash into a luggage lift .
the incident , which took place on december 26 , 2007 , left afoa unable to use his legs or right arm .
for years the case was locked in courts because the port of seattle claimed it was n't liable as afoa worked for a private company .
however , the state supreme court ruled the airport operator had a ` duty ' to provide a safe working environment .
a jury awarded the judgment on tuesday .
