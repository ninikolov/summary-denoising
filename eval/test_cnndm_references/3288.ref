the designer diffusion line went on sale sunday morning but was almost completely sold out online before noon , with stores selling out minutes after opening .
re-sellers initially tried to unload merchandise at inflated prices including $ 799 for a $ 150 hammock ; now thousands of pieces are available on ebay with smaller markups .
outraged customers have formed a social media campaign to boycott the merchandise from second-hand sellers .
