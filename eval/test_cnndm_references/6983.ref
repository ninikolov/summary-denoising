lindsey vonn was back at augusta friday to watch boyfriend tiger woods play in the second round of the masters .
vonn looked stressed at times though woods played a solid round , carding a three-under-par 69 .
woods is still well behind the leader , hot young american star jordan spieth .
the 21-year-old broke the 36 hole record on friday and is 14-under-par for the tournament , 12 strokes ahead of woods .
spieth led after three rounds last year and finished second at the tournament .
if spieth wins he would tie the record for the youngest winner in masters history with woods .
