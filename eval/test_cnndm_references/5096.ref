` my son seth , signed the petition asking me , dad , the governor , to veto this bill , ' republican gov. asa hutchinson said wednesday .
seth told daily mail online that ' i love and respect my father very much , but sometimes we have political disagreements '
he 's sending the ` religious freedom restoration act ' back to the state legislature because it strays too far from the federal law that inspired it .
hutchinson does n't risk a veto-override from lawmakers since he has n't technically vetoed the bill .
` this is a bill that in ordinary times would not be controversial , but these are not ordinary times , ' he said .
