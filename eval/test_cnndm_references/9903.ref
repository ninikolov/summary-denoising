jurors have started deliberations in the case against pedro hernandez , the man accused of killing 6-year-old etan patz in 1979 .
assistant district attorney joan illuzzi-orbon asked jurors in the ten week trial to convict hernandez of murder .
she described him as a calculated killer who committed a terrible crime and then spent three decades trying to hide from it .
the defense says hernandez 's admissions are made up , the ravings of a mentally ill man who sees visions and has a low iq .
