inca kingdom in the andes was connected via handwoven rope bridges .
today , only one bridge remains - the keshwa chaca near huinchiri , peru .
the 90ft-long bridge is rebuilt by villagers over three days every june , before gradually disintegrating each time .
locals use the same techniques to make the rope as their inca ancestors .
