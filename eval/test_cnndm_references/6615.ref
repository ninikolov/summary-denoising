hikers often stumble upon the unusual concrete markers and wonder why they were built .
the arrows directed the first air mail planes across the us to deliver post .
they lay at the bottom of lit beacons and showed pilots the direction to fly in to arrive at the next air field .
while they are no longer used , many lie forgotten until they are found by arrow-hunting fans .
