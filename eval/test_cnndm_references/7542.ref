clinton claimed wednesday in iowa that ` all my grandparents came over here ' as immigrants .
she said last year that one of her grandmothers immigrated to pennsylvania and worked in a silk mill .
but buzzfeed found american census records showing that only one clinton grandfather , adn neither of their wives , was born outside the us .
clinton apparently shaded the truth to seem more authentic with her argument that illegal immigrants should have more legal access to jobs .
