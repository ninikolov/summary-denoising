fbi director james comey suggested in remarks last week that poles were accomplices during the holocaust .
comey 's comments are offensive to poles as they had no role in running death camps and were themselves victims of the third reich .
poles see themselves as heroes of the war who have never been properly recognized , making the comments yet more hurtful .
the remarks came shortly before the 72nd anniversary of the warsaw ghetto uprising , which was commemorated on sunday .
the u.s. ambassador to poland , stephen mull , was called to the foreign ministry in a formal act of protest .
the incident echoes a gaffe by president obama in 2012 when he referred to ' a polish death camp ' - he offered his regrets for the error .
