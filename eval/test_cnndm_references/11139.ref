tommy cox from colchester looks just like prince george of cambridge .
both two-year-olds have the same rosy cheeks and a similar hairstyle .
even tommy 's mother - who is also called kate - thinks they look alike .
while he looks like george , tommy 's mother admits her son 's behaviour sometimes falls rather short of regal .
