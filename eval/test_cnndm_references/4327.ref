gate at border field state park , california , was opened for selected families on sunday in honor of children 's day .
it was only the second time it had been unlocked by border patrol officers since it was put in place in mid-1990s .
two young boys fell to their knees as they saw mom for first time in two years after she was deported to mexico .
` we talked about how life was without our mom . about how much we love each other , ' said one of boys , aged 10 .
meanwhile , one grandmother wept as she embraced her seven-year-old granddaughter in front of photographers .
many of the deported relatives had been living in us without documentation - and had not seen families for years .
they were given just minutes to hug and kiss their loved ones ; event was organised by non-profit border angels .
