the nfl announced today that greg hardy would be suspended without pay for 10 games at the start of the 2015 season .
hardy was convicted by a judge in july of beating , strangling and threatening to kill ex-girlfriend nicki holder .
holder told police that hardy choked her , slammed her against a bathtub , threw her to the floor and threatened to kill her after a fight at his condo .
charges were eventually dropped after holder could not be located when hardy 's lawyers appealed the decision and asked for a jury trial .
he was forced to leave the carolina panthers as a result of these charges last season , but still collected his salary of roughly $ 770,000 a week .
