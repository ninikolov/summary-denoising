her mother 's boyfriend , robert seman , 46 , was set to go on trial later that day for allegedly molesting her over four years .
seman was under house arrest at the time but was taken into custody on monday in connection with an alleged bribe , not the fire , police said .
investigators said they have found no evidence that the cause of the fire was suspicious .
her mother , who was found at seman 's home , has also been questioned .
