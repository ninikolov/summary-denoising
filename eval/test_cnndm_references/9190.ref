president barack obama is calling for an end to psychiatric therapy treatments aimed at turning gays into heterosexuals .
the move comes in response to an online petition posted on the white house website following the death of 17-year-old leelah alcorn .
the american psychiatric association has long opposed conversion therapy and says being gay is not a mental disorder .
