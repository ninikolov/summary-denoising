asia siddiqui , one of two femlae isis converts arrested in new york on thursday , had a jihad-themed poem published in an al qaeda magazine .
the poem , titled ` take me to the land where the eyes are cooled ' , is a gory account of her dream to become a martyr .
the poem was published by samir khan , an american citizen and one-time editor of al qaeda magazine inspire , who siddiqui met in 2006 .
khan wrote a how-to guide for bomb-making for inspire , which is believed to have been used by the accused boston bombers .
khan was killed in a 2011 drone strike in yemen .
