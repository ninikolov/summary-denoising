leo grand was offered a deal : either $ 100 or lessons in coding from patrick mcconlogue , who passed him on the street every day .
after daily coding lessons grand launched carpooling app trees for cars .
grand said he made $ 15,000 from the app , which is no longer in stores because he does not want to pay for the server space .
he said he has n't found the time to code every day anymore .
grand insists he likes living outdoors , but said he should have come up with an idea that made more money .
