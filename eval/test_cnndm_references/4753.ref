he has not signed the lucrative contract liverpool waved in front of him and he gave an interview to the bbc without clearing it with the club .
but imagine if raheem sterling had actually done something wrong .
he has been called avaricious , capricious , disloyal and impressionable .
we talk about loyalty in football as if it is a one-way street .
clubs generally have very little loyalty to players . they treat them as commodities .
if he asks for time to think before he commits himself , it is absurdly unjust that he should be pilloried for it .
