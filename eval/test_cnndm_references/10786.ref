nasa scientists in california have revealed a distant image of curiosity taken by the mars reconnaissance orbiter .
it was taken from an altitude of 187 miles -lrb- 300km -rrb- up , revealing where the rover is heading towards .
one interesting aspect is that the rover 's tracks can not be seen behind it in the image .
this may be due to martian weather or that they are the same colour as the surrounding surface .
