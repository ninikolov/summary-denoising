the woolworths ` fresh in our memories ' campaign launched last week .
it invited customers to upload images to remember australians who fought for their country .
the supermarket then added a woolworths logo and slogan to the images .
customers took to social media to mock the campaign and express their anger with what they saw as a marketing ploy by the company .
woolworths has taken down the campaign and also denied that it was designed as a marketing strategy .
