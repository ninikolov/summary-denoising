hannah overton will not be tried on murder charges again in the death of her adopted son .
overton was found guilty in the 2006 of killing her adopted son andrew burd , who died of acute salt poisoning .
overton has denied killing the boy from the start and her husband and five children have stood by her side .
late last year her conviction was overturned because of ineffective counsel , but nueces county district attorney mark skurka was set to try her again .
skurka filed a motion to dismiss however and the judge granted his motion .
