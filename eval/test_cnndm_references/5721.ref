alexander bradley , a key witness in the aaron hernandez murder trial , told the jury on wednesday the football star had access to the murder weapon .
bradley claimed he saw someone hand hernandez a black glock pistol in a miami hotel .
bradley , who says he was hernandez 's former drug dealer and then best friend , was not allowed to testify that hernandez shot him in the eye .
prosecutors had contended the february shooting is relevant to the lloyd murder since it shows that hernandez had no trouble shooting his friends .
bradley is currently suing hernandez for shooting him .
during one sidebar bradley stared directly at hernandez , who refused to make eye contact .
the prosecution in the case is expected to rest tomorrow .
meanwhile , hernandez 's lawyer james sultan has implied he only plans on calling one witness when they begin their case on monday .
