kyle seitz , 37 , of connecticut , entered a so-called alford plea in which he did n't admit guilt but agreed there was enough evidence to convict him .
seitz forgot to take son benjamin to daycare last july and accidentally left him in the car for more than seven hours while he went to work , he says .
he returned to the car during the day and drove to get lunch , not realizing the toddler was in the backseat .
wife lindsey rogers-seitz wrote in a letter asking for leniency that her husband is an amazing father .
