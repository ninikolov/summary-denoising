the image was taken at sebastian inlet state park near vero beach , florida , by john bailey .
bailey has said the bobcat caught the shark after entering the water .
the bobcat might have been scared by his presence , since it scampered off toward the woods and let go of its find .
a spokesman for the florida fish and wildlife conservation commission believes the image is genuine .
