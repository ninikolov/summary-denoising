it took jurors just an hour to convict susan monica on the murder charges on tuesday .
on monday , monica 's former cellmate testified in court and said she sent her a letter signed from ` the sweetest murderer in jackson county '
prosecutors said monica murdered two handymen who worked on her farm between 2012 and 2013 .
monica said she killed the first man , stephen delicino , out of self defense when he attacked her .
she says she later found robert haney being eaten by her pigs and shot him out of mercy .
however , she never reported either of their deaths to police .
the remains were found buried on her farm , with signs that they had been fed on by animals - most likely her pigs .
