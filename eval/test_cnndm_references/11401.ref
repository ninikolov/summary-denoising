chipotle is stepping away from using gmos -lrb- genetically modified organisms -rrb- as ingredients .
the company 's rice , meat marinades , chips , salsa , and tortillas will not be made with gmos .
however , gmo-feed is still consumed by the chickens and pigs the company uses .
chipotle co-ceo steve ells has said ` they say these ingredients are safe , but i think we all know we 'd rather have food that does n't contain them '
