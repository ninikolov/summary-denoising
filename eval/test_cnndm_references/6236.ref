a contestant called tom left a lasting impression with viewers for all the wrong reasons on friday night .
host alex trebek asked : ` in common law , the age of this , signaling adulthood , is presumed to be 14 in boys & 12 in girls ? '
the first contestant to press his buzzer was tom who inexplicably answered : ` what is the age of consent ? '
the correct answer was puberty and tom 's inappropiate reply left him trending on twitter .
