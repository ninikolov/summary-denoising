the former milking parlour on mayfair 's farm street has four bedrooms , an indoor swimming pool and roof terrace .
it was once the site of a dairy where farmers housed cows for milking on the busy central london market street .
the original property was knocked down and replaced with the plush , modern mansion four years ago .
