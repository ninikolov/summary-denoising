not all turtles can swim , said florida wildlife officials this week after concerned beachgoers tried to throw baby tortoises in the ocean .
there were at least three reports of people trying to release gopher tortoises in the ocean because they were mistaken for sea turtles .
tortoises have toes with claws on each toe but sea turtles have flippers with just one or two claws on each fore flipper .
