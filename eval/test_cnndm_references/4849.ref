a wolf spider races across a kitchen floor in hallett cove , south australia .
unluckily for it it 's spotted by a man who smashes it with a broom .
following a few whacks hundreds of babies burst out of the female spider .
after hatching , spider babies crawl onto the mother 's back and stay there .
as most of the the spiders are now dead the man sweeps them all up .
