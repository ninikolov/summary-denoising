spanish national mar√≠a jose carrascosa , 49 , was jailed in 2006 after refusing to return her daughter to the custody of her father in new jersey .
she was released friday , in part because her estranged ex peter innes wrote a letter asking the court to do what 's best for their daughter , now 14 .
carrascosa , now the focus of widespread media attention in spain , plans to return to valencia as soon as possible to be with her daughter .
the two have already had a tearful reunion after carrascosa 's release via skype .
