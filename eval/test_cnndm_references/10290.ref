the yeatman has been open for just five years , but has the feel of a place steeped in decades-old tradition .
there is a wine theme throughout the five-star hotel , with guests enjoying amazing views of the douro river .
the hotel is built into a hill in vila nova de gaia , with almost every room themed after a portuguese winery .
