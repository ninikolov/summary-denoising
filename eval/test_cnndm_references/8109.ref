marty stroud admitted in a letter published in a louisiana newspaper last month that he was to blame for putting glenn ford behind bars in 1983 .
stroud : ' i was not as interested in justice as i was in winning '
ford , now 65 , was freed a year ago after evidence emerged showing he was not at the scene of the murder and has since been living on donations .
he has also been diagnosed with stage 4 cancer and has months to live .
stroud visited ford 's home to apologize to him face-to-face but ford told him he was not able to forgive him .
