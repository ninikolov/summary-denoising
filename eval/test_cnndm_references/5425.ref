us president barack obama said on saturday that diplomacy was the best option to deal with iran 's contested nuclear program .
this just two days after a framework was agreed upon which would curb iran 's nuclear program and potentially lift economic sanctions .
israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu said yesterday this new agreement would ` threaten the very survival of the state of israel '
many americans , especially republicans , also believe this has now paved the way for iran to develop an atomic bomb .
