youtube videos show four-month-old noah monte perfectly balancing on the palm of his father 's hand as he 's lifted through the air .
he apparently started performing the ` circus act ' when he was a month old .
but now - more than a year on - it appears he could be getting a little too heavy for his father to lift in the palm of his hand .
