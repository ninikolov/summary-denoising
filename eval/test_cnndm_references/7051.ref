shelly sterling has been awarded most of the nearly $ 3 million she had sought to be returned .
her lawyers successfully argued that money used to buy v. stiviano a house , luxury cars and stocks was her community property .
stiviano 's lawyer had argued the gifts were made when donald and shelly sterling were separated .
ruling comes nearly a year after stiviano 's recording of donald sterling making racially offensive remarks that cost him ownership of the clippers .
shelly had filed the suit about a month before the recording of donald telling stiviano not to associate with black people created an uproar .
