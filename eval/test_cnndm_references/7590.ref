650 seats up for grabs on may 7 but more than half will not change hands because one party is so far ahead .
electoral reform society calls result in 325 seats in england , 5 in scotland , 20 in wales and 14 in northern ireland .
70 % of seats in the east of england are considered safe but only 10 % per cent in scotland as snp makes big gains .
