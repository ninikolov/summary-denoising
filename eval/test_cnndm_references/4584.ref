england captain alastair cook has been working on a new batting stance .
his new stance has his front foot too far out without protecting the wicket .
as a result , he does n't have time to adjust to the delivery and set himself .
cook probably overdid his new stance against the west indies .
still , he should n't be written off just yet and impressed in training .
