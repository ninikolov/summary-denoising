cleveland 's variety theater was a renowned rock venue that hosted the likes of metallica , rem and dead kennedy 's .
but as metal band motorhead performed in 1984 , the ceiling cracked and plaster began to fall on to the audience .
the gig was stopped and the theater was sealed off two years later - staying hidden from the public for 30 years .
now a photojournalist has ventured into the building , capturing eery photos that offer a glimpse into music history .
