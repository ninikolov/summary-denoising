retail experts say sales of royal memorabilia are unlikely to top # 70m .
by comparison , prince george 's birth resulted in a # 247m splurge .
between july and august 2013 , # 70m was lavished on souvenirs alone .
the newest royal is expected to have a big long term impact however .
sales boost will be particularly noticeable if the new baby is a girl .
