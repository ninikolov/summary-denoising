yaphank in long island was founded in part by the german american bund , a pro nazi group that flourished in the 1930s .
they established camp siegfried in 1935 as a place for like-minded aryans to drink beer , hold military demonstrations and learn about eugenics .
yaphank remains a town in long island , but gone are the roads once called adolf hitler street , goebbels and goering .
