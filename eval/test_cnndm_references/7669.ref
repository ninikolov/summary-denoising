more than 200 mummified bodies were found in a hidden crypt of the dominican church in the city of v√°c in hungary during restoration work .
geneticists led by scientists at the university of warwick studied samples from 26 of the bodies and found that eight of them had died of tuberculosis .
they discovered dna of 14 different strains of tb bacteria in the mummies .
analysis showed the strains all descended from a single strain that begun causing infections during the late roman empire between 396ce-470ce .
