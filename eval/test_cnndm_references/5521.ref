eight animals are dead , including at least one alligator that once belonged to michael jackson after a fire last week at an oklahoma zoo .
the zoo 's founder , joe schreibvogel , said the fire was most likely set by rogue animal rights activists who have been targeting the zoo .
schreibvogel : ` the building can be replaced ... michael jackson 's alligators can not be replaced '
