the 11 teachers , testing coordinators and other administrators were convicted wednesday of racketeering after a five-year investigation .
evidence of cheating was found in 44 schools across the atlanta school system , with nearly 180 educators involved .
a racketeering charge could carry up to 20 years in prison and most of the defendants will be sentenced on april 8 .
the cheating came to light after the atlanta journal-constitution reported in 2008 that some student 's scores were statistically improbable .
prosecutors said the educators were guaranteed bonuses by inflating scores , while improving the poor reputation of their school system .
superintendent beverly hall , the alleged ringleader who received up to $ 500,000 in payouts , died of breast cancer as the scandal went to trial .
one principal would wear gloves to erase answers and write in new ones .
