tianwen chen and wife found a baby girl in a box by the road in 1989 .
they carried her home , even though they had little money to live off .
since then they have adopted more and more disabled children .
sadly nine of the children died and the couple soon used up their savings .
donations from the public mean they now have a brand new home .
