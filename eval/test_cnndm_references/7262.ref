the seven signs around hollywood were erected this week by street artist plastic jesus .
he says he got the idea while driving down melrose ave a few weeks ago .
a kardashian shopping on the street caused such a ruckus that traffic was stopped on the busy avenue and he thought ` how is this news ? '
plastic jesus says the signs are n't meant to target the kardashians specifically but the obsession with reality tv stars in general .
