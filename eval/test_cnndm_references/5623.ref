toni elliot , 53 , thought she had hurt a tooth when she sat for dinner at puckett 's boat house in franklin , tennessee , on thursday .
however , when she spat out the mouthful she was chewing she discovered a pearl in the palm of her hand .
forty-nine precious stones followed .
as naturally-occurring pearls are rare , it 's expected that elliot 's stash could fetch a princely sum .
