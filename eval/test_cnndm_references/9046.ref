shelley dufresne was arrested in september when a student at the high school she taught at started bragging about sleeping with two teachers .
it was later revealed that the 16-year-old had sex with both dufresne and his former english teacher , 24-year-old rachel respess .
dufresne , 32 , pleaded not guilty to charges in november , but changed course on thursday when she admitted having sex with the teen .
in a forgiving plea deal , dufresne will only have to attend a 90-day therapy program , stay away from the victim and turn in her teacher 's license .
in exchange , the charge of carnal knowledge of a child will be dropped after her probation and she wo n't have to register as a sex offender .
however , dufresne is still awaiting an arraignment on charges for having a threesome with the same student and respess in a different parish .
