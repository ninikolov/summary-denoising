town of evansville in comanche county was the headquarters of largest cattle ranch in kansas 's history in 1880s .
but now , its once-thriving commissary building , with post office , grocery store and possibly a hotel , are long gone .
however , the remote ghost town is still home to two final residents - rancher larry ` dee ' scherich and wife phyllis .
couple live in a house just north of ruined commissary building - and only ever encounter hired help in the region .
mrs scherich said of evansville : ` by 1910 , there was not much left ' , adding she would ` love ' to restore the buildings .
