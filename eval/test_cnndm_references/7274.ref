ken broskey livonia , michigan , has been diagnosed with stage 4 cancer and his doctors have urged him to check into hospice care .
instead he has taken a job with uber to earn money to pay off his mortgage before he dies so his daughter and grandchildren can have his house .
roland gainer , a college student , started a gofundme page for broskey after meeting him which has almost reached its $ 95,000 goal .
uber is also donating $ 1 to the page when people write uberpartnerken into their app when requesting a ride this weekend .
