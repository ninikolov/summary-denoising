uefa have ordered the final 18 seconds of the european women 's u19 championship qualifier between england and norway to be replayed .
referee marija kurtes incorrectly awarded an indirect free kick after disallowing an england penalty for encroachment .
fifa did something similar during a 2006 world cup qualifier .
but the entire match between uzbekistan and bahrain was replayed .
uefa must hope it does n't affect one of their premiere tournaments .
