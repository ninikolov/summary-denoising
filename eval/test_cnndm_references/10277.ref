#milifandom has sparked hundreds of tweets in support of ed miliband .
twitter frenzy was started by young labour supporter named ` abby '
internet jokers have joined in , posting mocked-up images of ed as characters from famous films including fifty shades of grey .
last week , the labour leader met an adoring hen party in chester .
adoration is unlikely to translate into votes - fans are mostly teenagers .
