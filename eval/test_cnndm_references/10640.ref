eight faculty members at columbia university penned an op-ed accusing dr oz 's on-air tactics of sullying the reputation of the ivy league school .
but they said he should not be forced to stepped down from his ` well-earned position ' at columbia because of these ` foibles '
it comes after 10 doctors called on columbia to fire oz for promoting ` quack treatments ' on his tv show , including weight-loss supplements .
the piece came as dr oz insisted his show would survive the criticism and said the doctors only attacked him for supporting gma labeling .
