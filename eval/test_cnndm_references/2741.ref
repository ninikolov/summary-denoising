tottenham forward emmanuel adebayor has taken to twitter to insist his immediate future remains at white hart lane .
he has one year left to run on his current contract at spurs .
adebayor joined spurs in 2011 from manchester city , initially on loan before an impressive first season convinced them to make the move permanent .
unfortunately , adebayor has not managed to rediscover his early form and has been reduced to a bit-part player in mauricio pochettino 's plans .
he has not scored a league goal for spurs since october .
