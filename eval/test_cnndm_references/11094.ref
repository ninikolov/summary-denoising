the bridal centre , in brisbane , shut down unexpectedly earlier this month .
around 140 brides were left out of pocket and without a dress .
they created a facebook page called ` where 's my dress ' so the women could connect and try to find alternative ways to get their dream dress .
ladies and bridal companies started to donate dresses to the women .
adele mckenzie was one of the women who have been left without a dress .
she said the way the brides have been treated is ` disgraceful '
many brides have taken to social media to slam the bankrupt company .
