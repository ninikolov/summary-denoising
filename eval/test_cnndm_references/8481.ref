this is the final week of our major good health series on dementia .
we turn our attention to carers and what can be done to make life easier .
in england there are more than 670,000 unpaid carers helping someone .
we explain what to if they become anxious as the light starts to fade .
bed and getting-up times .
when to take medication .
meal times .
shopping days .
leisure time such as tv , radio or social times .
before you start talking always engage eye contact to help get the person with dementia to focus on you . there can be a tendency for them to look away and this makes it harder for them to concentrate on the conversation .
be careful about asking questions they may be unable to process . for example , if they 're upset do n't ask what 's wrong as they may not know , or are unable to put it into words . instead , tell them : ` you seem to be upset ; let 's think how we can make you feel better . '
finishing sentences for them can increase frustration . it 's better to ask if they 'd like you to find words for them if they 're having difficulty .
watch their body language as this can give you clues about how they are feeling . for example , repetitive movements can mean they are anxious or scared , while withdrawing may mean they feel overwhelmed .
if they 're doing something obviously wrong , for example putting dishes in the washing machine or clothes in a food cupboard , do n't ask them why or castigate them - the reasoning side of their brain has been affected and pointing out their mistakes will only cause them embarrassment and frustration .
