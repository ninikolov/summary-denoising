alice barker danced in legendary apollo and zanzibar clubs during the 1930s harlem renaissance , as well as movies , tv and commercials .
but she had lost her old photographs with time , and no one could find her videos because of a misspelling of her name .
david shuff , who met barker years ago , reunited her with some of her short musical films known then as ` soundies '
the videos now play in the common room of her retirement home , where shuff says she is a ` rock star '
