luis suarez was liverpool 's player of last season .
but who would earn that accolade this year ? jordan henderson has many backers , as does coutinho .
several , among them emre can and raheem sterling , have shone in parts .
there have been lots of adequate contributions but there has n't been anywhere near enough consistency .
if liverpool are going to clamber into the top four and win the fa cup , much will depend on the little brazilian .
