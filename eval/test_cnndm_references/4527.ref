sarah jewell , 25 , went to local social security office to prove she 's alive .
she learned someone had filed her number as deceased in november 2014 .
jewell said the office implied ` everything 's taken care of ' and she was fine .
but after three months her number has n't been reinstated , she has n't received her tax refund , and her driver 's license also lists her as deceased .
and now she 's in jeopardy of losing her job as a licensed pharmacist .
