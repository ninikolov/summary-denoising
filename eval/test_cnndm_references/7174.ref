the zambi wildlife retreat is the only facility for retired exotic animals from zoos and the movie industry in australia .
the sydney retreat is home to lions , tigers , monkeys and dingoes as well as rescued farm and domestic animals .
the retreat is hoping to raise money to expand its facilities so it can accept more animals and open a training centre .
although not yet open to the public , you can now ` adopt ' one of the zambi pride to support the non-profit facility .
