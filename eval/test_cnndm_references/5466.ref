it has long been known that earth is constantly oscillating and ` humming '
earthquakes cause a certain level of hum , but a study claims different sized ocean waves also contribute to earth 's oscillations .
as water collides , it creates weak microseismic waves that cause a hum .
stronger seismic waves then occurs when water travels along the floor .
