sutherland council is exploring idea of allowing overseas backpackers to park their campervans in allocated locations right on the beach .
cronulla and wanda beach are often ignored by tourists due to expenses .
this motion was proposed due to the economic boost backpackers bring .
seasoned travellers spend $ 700 on eating out and shopping during a stay .
some locals believe it can not be done due to rising land values in cronulla .
