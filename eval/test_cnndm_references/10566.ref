tv doctor used thursday 's show to hit back at his critics who he accused of having ` conflict of interest issues - and some integrity ones also '
ten doctors signed a letter last week calling oz a ` charlatan ' who promotes ` quack treatments '
oz said he was being targetted because he supports gmo labeling .
his show featured a report on how some of the 10 doctors have received grants from monsanto , who manufactures gmo seeds .
he also told nbc news that the dr. oz show is actually ` not a medical show , ' but it will no longer use ` inflammatory ' words like ` miracle '
