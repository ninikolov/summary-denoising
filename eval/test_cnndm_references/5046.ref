donny ray williams on friday was given a suspended sentence and 5 years probation for two 2010 sexual assaults .
prosecutors spared williams jail time largely because of his severe medical issues stemming from an unrelated 2013 acid attack .
williams was once a staffer for the senate homeland security and government affairs disaster recovery subcommittees .
