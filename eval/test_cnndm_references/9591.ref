the taxpayer-funded temporary assistance for needy families program , currently provides payments of up to $ 497 per month for a family of four .
the list of do n'ts , included by the republican-dominated kansas legislature in a bill that gop gov. sam brownback planned to sign thursday , runs to several dozen items .
the number of cash assistance recipients in kansas has dropped 63per cent since brownback took office , to about 14,700 in february .
brownback said the decline confirms the success of his policies , but critics note that u.s. census bureau figures show the state 's child poverty rate remaining at about 19per cent through 2013 .
