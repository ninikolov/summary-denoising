richard lapointe , a former dishwasher , confessed to raping and stabbing 88-year-old bernice martin at her manchester apartment in 1989 .
he was sentenced in 1992 to life in prison without parole .
lapointe 's supporters said evidence showed he could not have committed the crimes and his disability made him vulnerable to a false confession .
last month a court ruled lapointe was deprived of a fair trial and on friday , a judge ordered him to be freed on $ 25,000 cash bail .
