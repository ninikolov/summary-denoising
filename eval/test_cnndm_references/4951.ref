louis jordan , 37 , had been missing at sea for more than two months before he was picked up off the north carolina coast by a ship on thursday .
jordan had told his family in january that he was ` going into the open water ' to go fishing but the boat capsized and the mast broke .
he was found sitting on the capsized hull of his sailboat and plucked from the sea by a helicopter .
he had a broken collarbone and was dehydrated but looked in good health and was able to walk to the hospital unaided .
` to us it 's just a miracle . we 're just so thrilled that he was found alive , ' said his mother norma davis .
jordan told rescuers he survived drinking rain water and eating raw fish and read a bible repeatedly from cover to cover .
