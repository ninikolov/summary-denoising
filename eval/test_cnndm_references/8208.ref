visited spartia in the south of kefalonia and then fiscardo , in the north .
first , from villa hephaestus , could see lourdas bay and zakynthos island .
charming local , family-run eateries were found throughout the island .
nightlife is virtually non-existent , so spent energy exploring during the day .
fiscardo , once a remote fishing port , is now a world-class yachting centre .
