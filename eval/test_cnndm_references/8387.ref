dashcam footage shows the officers using their patrol vehicles to steer the one ton bison off the road and back to his farm near the city of round rock .
as they beep their horns the animal , named big boy , continues to run along the sidewalk .
however , at one point he veers in front of the police car and on to the other side of the road .
despite the detour , the buffalo made it home safely free of injury .
