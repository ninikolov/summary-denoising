liz smith , 92 , is spilling celebrity secrets that she never printed over the course of her 70-year career .
smith began working at 25 and went on to become the gossip columnist for both the new york post and new york daily news .
smith , a lesbian , claims iac chairman barry diller asked her in 1992 : ` do you think i should come out ? '
despite this claim , smith says diller is in love with his wife diane von furstenberg , who he has been with since the 1970s and married in 2001 .
as for enemies , she never again spoke to jackie kennedy 's sister lee radziwill after she refused to defend truman capote and called him a ` f ** '
she counts elizabeth taylor , elaine stritch , former texas governor ann richard and bette midler as her closest friends .
barbara walters was a good friend she claims , but lost interest in smith when she lost her newspaper column at the post .
