robert tomanovich first hung a noose and a confederate flag , printed with the slogan ' i ai n't coming down , ' on a fence at his michigan home .
neighbours complained so an employee of tomanovich 's hung a second noose outside his tree-cutting business .
tomanovich said he simply liked the colors of the flag and his wife claimed the noose was a tribute to a dead friend of her husband .
he has since taken down the nooses and flags , but refuses to apologize .
