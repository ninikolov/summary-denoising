vlad tarasov could n't resist filming himself ski down the slopes at boston 's largest snow farm located in the city 's seaport district .
his one-minute video gives a first-person perspective of pushing through the filthy , trash-filled ice pile that served as a dumping ground for the snow .
` i 've been skiing for 20 years , but never like this , ' he said about the ` surreal ' experience .
junk in the filthy snow included rusted lawn chairs , parking cones , broken bottles and even a dead seagull .
