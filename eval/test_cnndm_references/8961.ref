twin cities radio host mary lucia wrote a letter to her fans on wednesday saying she would be taking some time off work following her ordeal .
she described how she has ` constantly been looking over my shoulder ' after a stranger began contacting her incessantly from march 2014 .
patrick henry kelly ` repeatedly called her at work and home and wrote her letters saying they should be together '
he ` left gifts including wine , candles , a calculator and food at her home '
after repeatedly violating a restraining order she had taken out against him , he was charged last year and goes on trial next week .
