the queen has distributed the traditional maundy money in sheffield .
two bags of coins were presented to 89 men and 89 women during service .
one was brave d-day veteran , 91-year-old denis gratton .
her majesty arrived in the city on the royal train with prince philip .
royal maundy tradition dates back to 1210 and the infamous king john .
john , who appears in robin hood , was also forced to sign the magna carta .
royals were once required to wash the feet of beggars during the service .
only the nosegay , intended to hide the smell , still survives of that part .
