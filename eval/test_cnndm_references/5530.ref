gaby tillero and greg ensslen bought the home after a church claimed they wanted to demolish it and expand their lot .
the home was dismantled and stored for a year before the couple found a lot across new orleans that would fit the home 's dimensions .
tillero and her husband ensslen now live in the home with their two sons , six-year-old santiago and nine-year-old javier , as well as tillero 's mother , olga tillero .
the couple stayed true to the cottage 's floor plan , while converting it from a duplex to a single-family home .
they used salvaged and recycled materials to decorate the interior and exterior of the home .
