elderly fishermen in guilin , china , keep the unusual , ancient tradition of cormorant bird fishing alive .
the bird , which they have often raised from a chick , dives into the water and retrieves a carp for its owner .
this is an ecologically safe way of fishing , as the birds are not harmed and the men only catch what they need .
