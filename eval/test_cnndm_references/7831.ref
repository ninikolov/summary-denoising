heather hironimus and the boy 's father , dennis nebus , have been warring since her pregnancy .
they were never married but share custody of their 4-year-old child .
in a parenting agreement filed in court , the two agreed to the boy 's circumcision .
hironimus later changed her mind , giving way to a long court battle .
she filed a federal civil rights complaint late monday .
it repeats the claims that surgery on her 4-year-old son is n't necessary , that the boy does n't want it , and that his constitutional rights are being violated .
hironimus is also trying to avoid her own arrest .
the arrest was ordered after she fled in february and ignored a judge 's demand that she appear in court and allow the surgery to go forward .
