jane laut , 57 , stands accused of shooting dead her bronze medalist shot-putter husband dave laut in august 2009 .
laut claims self-defense while prosecutors say she 's a murderer -- however , they were unable to get a case together by the time of the trial .
when a california judge threw out the prosecution 's request again delay the several times postponed trial , they dropped the charges and refiled .
the defense calls the maneuver an unprofessional delay tactic almost unheard of in a murder case .
