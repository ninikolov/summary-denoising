zoo weekly came under fire for their scandalous anzac day issue .
the front cover featured a half-naked model holding a red poppy .
the department of veteran affairs said zoo could not use the word anzac .
the word ca n't be used without permission for commercial purposes .
social media users condemned the ` gross and offensive ' issue .
zoo weekly has since removed all offending images from their websites .
