yellowstone area bar association president jessica fehr said thursday that baugh was chosen for the award by the group 's board of directors .
baugh , 73 , sparked widespread outrage in 2013 over comments suggesting that 14-year-old girl shared some responsibility for her rape by a teacher .
he sentenced stacey rambold to just one month in prison in the case .

he also described moralez as ` older than her chronological age ' and called her a troubled youth .
moralez killed herself before the case went to trial .
after prosecutors appealed , rambold was re-sentenced in september and is serving 10 years in montana state prison . he is appealing the sentence .
