artist betty willis designed the famous neon sign in 1959 .
the sign sits in a median in the middle of las vegas boulevard south of the strip and is a popular tourist attraction .
in 2009 it was placed on the national register of historic places .
no one owns the copyright to the sign , so it is often imitated and appears on all kinds of souvenirs in las vegas and elsewhere .
