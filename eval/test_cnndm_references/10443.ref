photographers in the uk captured the lyrid meteor shower in the sky last night .
it occurs every year around 16 to 25 april , so you can still catch some meteors tonight and tomorrow .
the strength of the showers vary from year to year and most years there are no more than 20 meteors an hour .
but in 1982 americans counted nearly 100 an hour and in 1803 it was as high as 700 an hour .
