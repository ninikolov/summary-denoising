the flexible aluminium battery was created at stanford university .
it consists of a negatively charged aluminium anode and a positively charged graphite cathode along with an ionic liquid electrolyte .
it sits in a flexible polymer-coated ` pouch ' and recharges in one minute .
but it currently offers just half the voltage of existing lithium-ion batteries .
