after beating tommy burns in 1908 , jack johnson became the first ever black world heavyweight champion .
he held the belt for six years and sunday will mark the 100 year anniversary of his last title defence .
during a particularly racist period of american history , johnson 's title reign was met with many protests .
johnson was eventually defeated by jess willard in 1915 , following 26 brutal rounds in the sweltering heat of cuba .
