phillip buchanon was a first-round draft pick for the oakland raiders in 2002 when his mother made what he called the ` desperate demand '
buchanon , who is now retired , instead bought her a brand new house .
but she refused to sell her old house and rented it to her sister .
so he ended up paying maintenance for both houses for seven years without getting any of the rent money .
when buchanon finally had enough his mother asked for $ 15,000 instead of a smaller house whose upkeep she could afford .
