brock guzman , 8 , was taken from his home when someone stole the family car from their driveway as he slept inside monday morning .
he was found shortly after a few miles away in fairfield , california .
his parents , paul and suzanne , are now filing a formal complaint against police for the way they were treated after they reported the incident .
suzanne was handcuffed and thrown to the ground by officers , something paul claims he captured in a video .
cops say this happened because they say what they thought was blood inside the house and suzanne refused to let them in .
the family says they wanted to protect police from their dog who they thought would attack the officers .
