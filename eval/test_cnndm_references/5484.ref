helaman barlow was police chief of twin towns of colorado city , arizona , and hildale , utah but admits he did things he now regrets .
he said he knew of underage marriages happening in the community and was asked by church leaders to change police reports .
he also recorded conversations with law enforcement and passed them on to jeffs when he was on the run and being sought by the fbi .
jeffs , the leader of the fundamentalist church of latter-day saints , is now serving life in prison for marrying and raping two 12-year-old girls .
federal investigators are now suing the towns ' governments , accusing them of being controlled by the church .
