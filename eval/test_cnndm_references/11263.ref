lynne briggs only applied for one school because it is only 150 yards away .
but her daughter charlotte has instead been offered place two miles away .
her mother says she must leave job because she faces four hours on bus .
council says mrs briggs wrongly assumed child was in a ` feeder school '
as a result , despite being in catchment area , charlotte was refused place .
