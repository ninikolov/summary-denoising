a group of fighters in afghanistan is filmed by a cnn cameraman parading isis flags .
u.s. official : isis militants have `` no military capability '' at present , but are trying to recruit disillusioned taliban in several areas .
rivalry between isis and the taliban in afghanistan is fierce enough to mean the isis fighters could be killed for brandishing the flag .
