keepers at the columbus zoo say ten-year-old irisa had bred before but never conceived .
however , this spring it was found the female cat was pregnant .
while the birth on tuesday went smoothly , irisa failed to show any maternal care so her offspring are being hand-reared in an incubator .
they currently weigh 2.5 lbs but are set to grow to a heftier 650lbs .
