binh wagner , a 3-year-old vietnamese girl adopted by an ontario family , was recovering monday following a liver transplant .
earlier this year , her twin phuoc received a liver from their adopted father michael wagner but binh 's fate remained uncertain .
the identical twins suffer from a genetic disease called alagille syndrome , which leads to a buildup of bile in the liver , causing damage to liver cells .
