mother was at charity easter egg hunt at melbourne 's caulfield racecourse .
a volunteer at the event on saturday told her to stop taking too many eggs .
she told the 13-year-old to ` f *** off ' and continued to deny she was doing it .
but she became so rowdy security guards had to throw her out of the hunt .
the easter event was held to raise money for zaidee 's rainbow foundation .
foundation aims to make people more aware of organ and tissue donation .
